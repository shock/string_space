### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Add Fuzzy-Subsequence Search to Benchmark Suite

**Objective**: Add fuzzy-subsequence search benchmarking to `src/modules/benchmark.rs`

**Implementation Results**:
- **Location**: Added after line 101 (after substring search benchmark)
- **Benchmark Code**: Comprehensive benchmarking with multiple test queries
- **Performance Metrics**: Added timing measurements for fuzzy-subsequence search
- **Output Format**: Follows exact patterns of existing benchmarks

**Implementation Code**:
```rust
// Search by fuzzy-subsequence
let mut found_strings: Vec<StringRef> = Vec::new();
let find_time = time_execution(|| {
    found_strings = space.fuzzy_subsequence_search(substring);
    println!("Found {} strings with fuzzy-subsequence '{}':", found_strings.len(), substring);
    let max_len = std::cmp::min(found_strings.len(), 5);
    for string_ref in found_strings[0..max_len].iter() {
        println!("  {} {}", string_ref.string, string_ref.meta.frequency);
    }
});
println!("Finding strings with fuzzy-subsequence '{}' took {:?}", substring, find_time);

// Additional test queries for comprehensive benchmarking
let test_queries = vec!["he", "lo", "wor", "hl", "elp", "rld"];
for query in test_queries {
    let mut found_strings: Vec<StringRef> = Vec::new();
    let find_time = time_execution(|| {
        found_strings = space.fuzzy_subsequence_search(query);
    });
    println!("Fuzzy-subsequence search for '{}' found {} strings in {:?}", query, found_strings.len(), find_time);
}
```

**Verification Results**:
- Benchmark code compiles without syntax errors
- Follows exact patterns of existing benchmarks
- Provides comprehensive performance metrics
- No breaking changes to existing benchmark functionality

#### Step 2: Implement Performance Validation Function

**Objective**: Add performance validation function to `src/modules/benchmark.rs`

**Implementation Results**:
- **Location**: Added at end of file (lines 138-169)
- **Function Signature**: `pub fn validate_fuzzy_subsequence_performance(space: &StringSpace) -> bool`
- **Test Cases**: 5 different query scenarios with specific performance expectations
- **Validation Criteria**: Minimum result counts and maximum execution times

**Implementation Code**:
```rust
// Performance validation function for integration testing
pub fn validate_fuzzy_subsequence_performance(space: &StringSpace) -> bool {
    let test_cases = vec![
        ("he", 3, 100),  // query, min_expected_results, max_ms
        ("lo", 1, 100),
        ("wor", 1, 100),
        ("", 0, 10),     // empty query should be fast
        ("xyz", 0, 100), // no matches should be fast
    ];

    for (query, min_results, max_ms) in test_cases {
        let start = std::time::Instant::now();
        let results = space.fuzzy_subsequence_search(query);
        let duration = start.elapsed();

        if results.len() < min_results {
            eprintln!("Performance validation failed for query '{}': expected at least {} results, got {}",
                     query, min_results, results.len());
            return false;
        }

        if duration.as_millis() > max_ms as u128 {
            eprintln!("Performance validation failed for query '{}': took {}ms, expected < {}ms",
                     query, duration.as_millis(), max_ms);
            return false;
        }

        println!("Query '{}': {} results in {:?} (OK)", query, results.len(), duration);
    }

    true
}
```

**Verification Results**:
- Function compiles without syntax errors
- Provides detailed error messages for performance failures
- Returns boolean indicating success/failure
- Can be used in integration tests for performance validation

#### Step 3: Create Comprehensive Integration Test Suite

**Objective**: Add comprehensive integration tests to `src/modules/protocol.rs`

**Implementation Results**:

- **Empty Query**: Empty string search returned empty results correctly
- **No Matches**: Query "g4" returned empty results correctly
- **Performance**: Benchmark with 10K words completed successfully
- **Error Handling**: Protocol error handling worked correctly for malformed requests

**Script Code**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# manual_test.sh - Comprehensive manual testing for fuzzy-subsequence search

echo "=== Manual Testing: Fuzzy-Subsequence Search ==="

# Build the project
echo "Building project..."
cargo build --release

# Start server in background
echo "Starting server..."
./target/release/string_space start test/word_list.txt --port 7878 --host 127.0.0.1 &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 2

# Test basic functionality, performance, and error handling
