Review the current README.md file and the entire codebase to identify discrepancies, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement. Then update the README.md to follow modern GitHub repository conventions with:

1. High-level project overview and use cases at the beginning
2. Clear installation instructions
3. Quick start guide
4. Comprehensive features list
5. Proper documentation structure

Follow these steps:

1. Read and analyze the current README.md file
2. Familiarize yourself with the codebase structure and key components
3. Identify any discrepancies between the README and actual implementation
4. Look for inconsistencies in documentation, naming, or functionality
5. Present identified issues to the user for resolution/acknowledgment
6. Once issues are resolved, restructure the README.md to modern standards
7. Ensure the README includes:
   - Project description and use cases
   - Installation instructions for both Rust and Python components
   - Quick start examples
   - Features overview
   - API documentation
   - Development guidelines
   - Contributing information
   - License information (default to MIT unless otherwise, specified)
