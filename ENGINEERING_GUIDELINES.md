# Engineering Guidelines

## Guidelines

- The app should be designed to be as simple and straightforward as possible, with a focus on usability and efficiency.
- The app should be modular, with a clear separation of concerns between different components.
- The app should be well-documented, with clear instructions and explanations of its functionality.
- The app should be tested thoroughly, with a focus on ensuring its functionality and reliability.
- Keep functions small and focused, with clear and concise names.
- Refactor long functions into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## Tests

- Use rust unit tests to validate the functionality of the app.
- Each function should have one or more corresponding unit test to ensure its correctness.
- There should be one or more integration tests to validate the app's behavior when used in a larger context.
- The integration tests should cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the app's robustness.
- The integration tests will use a real Python script and a directory of Python modules to test the app's functionality.

## Coding Conventions

- Prefer verbose variable names to make the code more readable.
- Use descriptive function and variable names to improve code readability.
- Prefer verbose code with comments over dense, cryptic code.
- ALWAYS USE BEST PRACTICES AND CONVENTIONS for the language you are using.
